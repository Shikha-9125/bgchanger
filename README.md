#Background Changer

This is a simple background changer application built using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to change the background color of the application by clicking a button.

Features
Vite: Utilized for fast and efficient development.
React: For building the user interface and managing the state.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the components with utility-first CSS classes.

How It Works
Button Click: The application displays a button on the screen. When the user clicks this button, the background color of the application changes randomly.
Random Colors: Each click generates a random color using JavaScript, and the background color of the app changes to this new color.
Tailwind CSS: The button and other UI elements are styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and modern design.
